# Shinobu-chan #
This project is dedicated to rewriting the Shinobu-chan bot. It was recently invited to a new server and with that, new code needs to be written. Simply put, the old code runs on Discord.js v12 which isn't great for Discord now. Discord.js v13 gives support to Interactions, Scheduled Events, and more! Additionally, I have discovered new methods to write the code, simplying it and making it faster. With that, I'll leave the details regarding how to use this code, what its primary purpose is, and how you can contribute!

## Objective ##
The objective of this project is to provide a Discord bot for an SCP roleplay server and make it open-source so that anyone who wishes to copy the code may do so and give their input regarding new features that could be used.

## Installation ##
Requirements
> Node.js Version 16
> Node Package Manager

Steps
> 1. Run npm ci
> 2. Run "node check-packages" to see if the packages matches packages.json
> 3. Edit the code as you want!

## New Features ##
I am more than happy to receive new ideas or features. If you have one, I strongly recommend that you try to code it yourself and do the best you can do. Once done, please submit a pull request following this format:

\# What is the objective of this PR?

\# Why should the feature be added?

\# Are there any special requirements needed to utilize this? (i.e. Specific config.json fields)

From there, the community and people with write access will review the changes and approve them if needed! Please note that if we do reject it or ask for changes, we'll state why and what you can do to improve. From there, you can improve, resubmit, and get reviewed again

## Issues ##
If you notice something wrong with the bot or the overall code, you are welcome to create an issue. Please make sure that this does not already have a pull request open regarding it or the problem exists on a fork (In that case, the issue should be opened on the fork repository). Please follow the format:

\# What is the main issue?

\# Where is this issue present?

\# Do you know of any solutions?

## Closing Remarks ##
That's all! If anyone has contributed anything special, I will list them below and give them credit
